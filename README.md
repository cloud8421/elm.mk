# Elm.mk

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloud8421/elm.mk.svg?branch=legacy)](https://travis-ci.org/cloud8421/elm.mk)

A minimal Makefile to work on [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) projects that require external js and css. It requires
a working Elm installation.

## Philosophy

The main goal of this boilerplate is to **minimise the needs for external dependencies** while providing an effective
development environment. This means that it tries as much as possible to bundle pre-compiled utilities to accomplish the needed tasks.

## Features

- [x] Cross-platform (OS X + Linux 64bit - help with Windows would be nice)
- [x] Elm [StartApp](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/start-app/2.0.2/) installation
- [x] Project scaffold generation
- [x] Elm compilation with warnings
- [x] Scss compilation via [Wellington](https://github.com/wellington/wellington)
- [x] Watch and recompile via [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd)
- [x] Images (without optimization)
- [x] Live reload via [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd)
- [x] File generators based on templates
- [x] Support for unit testing (optional)
- [x] Support for minified builds (experimental)

## Setup from scratch

- `mkdir my_new_project && cd my_new_project`
- `curl -o elm.mk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud8421/elm.mk/legacy/elm.mk`
- `make -f elm.mk install`

This will generate the needed folder structure and files. Note that at the end of `make install`, you're left with
an empty `Makefile` that includes `elm.mk`, so that you can extend it for your needs and/or override its behaviour.

## Project workflow

Main commands:

- `make install`: installs all needed dependencies
- `make`: compiles the project into `build`
- `make prod`: compresses compiled files in `dist`
- `make server`: serves the build folder with a local http server
- `make watch`: starts the file watcher and the http server, recompiling files on save
- `make clean`: deletes all compiled files
- `make help`: shows all main tasks

Some guidelines:

- Files generated into `build` should not be edited manually
- All other files can be modified
- Source `.elm` files should be placed in `src`.
- Use `src/boot.js` to start your Elm application and define all ports-related glue code with the external world. The file gets copied automatically to `build`.
- `styles/main.scss` is the stylesheet main file.
- `index.html` gets copied the way it is into `build`
- All images can be placed in `images/`, they will be automatically copied to `build/images`

It may also be worth checking out the documentation for the software used in this boilerplate (like Devd or Modd), as they provide functionality that it's not covered here.

## Extending install targets

Install targets represent tooling dependencies that your project has.

For example you may wanna add support for image compression using a hypothetical tool called `compress`, whose binary you can download.

In your `Makefile`, you can add a `CUSTOM_INSTALL_TARGETS` definition, which will be picked up by `make install`:

```
CUSTOM_INSTALL_TARGETS := bin/compress

bin/compress:
  curl -o $@ http://example.com/compress
```

## Extending compile targets

Compile targets represent the artifacts your project builds every time you run `make`.

For example, if you want to add a second html page to the project, you can extend `CUSTOM_COMPILE_TARGETS`:

```
CUSTOM_COMPILE_TARGETS := build/home.html

build/home.html: home.html
  cp $< $@
```

## Extending dist targets

Dist targets represent the artifacts your project builds every time you run `make prod`.

For example, if you want to add a second html page to the project, you can extend `CUSTOM_DIST_TARGETS`:

```
CUSTOM_DIST_TARGETS := dist/home.html

dist/home.html: home.html
  cp $< $@
```

## Testing

It's possible to add support for unit testing via <https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-elm-test>.

To do that, it's enough to call `make test`, which will install the needed dependencies. Note that this requires Node to be installed.

Calling `make test` again will rerun the test suite.

## Production builds [Experimental]

As mentioned above, running `make prod` will build and minify files for production via [UglifyJS 2](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) and Wellington (i.e. css generated with compressed layout). While this seems to work fine, it's under testing to see if it holds for more complex builds than just a few files.

## FAQs/Comments

#### I don't think this should use X, Y is a better fit.
As long as it's easy to install in portable format (i.e. download in the project folder and run), please feel free to state the case for a replacement

#### Why is feature X missing?
Probably because I haven't thought about it.

#### Why Make?
Make is ubiquitous, mostly pre-installed (or very easy to install) and language-agnostic. It takes some time to adjust to it, but it's fast, effective and modular.

#### This make task is not optimal, it's much better if you change it like this!
Please submit a PR, I'm happy to learn

#### I don't know Make, but I'd like to help. Where can I learn more?
Smashing Magazine has a [very good introduction](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/building-web-applications-with-make/) and there are [good books](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006105.do) out there. They mostly focus on usage with C, but they should work out fine.
